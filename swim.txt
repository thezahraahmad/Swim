    <h2> Different Swimming Styles </h2>
<p> Swimming by definition is the sport or activity of propelling oneself through water using the limbs. This is a very broad classification and therefore there are many different styles of swimming, read on to find out about the most popular ones.
    <h3> Front crawl </h3>
 The front crawl, also known the freestyle stroke, is the fastest and most efficient of the swimming strokes used in competition. This is why it is used in freestyle races and is also often the favorite stroke for experienced swimmers and triathletes.
<p>

    <h3> Backstroke </h3>
<p>
    As its name suggests, backstroke is swum on the back. It uses alternating circular arm movements and an above water recovery. The legs execute a flutter kick similar to the one used in freestyle/frontcrawl.
